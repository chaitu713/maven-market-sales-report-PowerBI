MAVEN MARKET SALES REPORT USING POWER BI

  Maven Market, a multi-national grocery chain with locations in Canada, Mexico and the United States wants us to design a end-to-end business solution from 
  scratch including tracking of KPIs (sales, revenue, profit, returns), compare regional performance, weekly revenue trend, and revenue vs target information.

  We're given a folder of raw CSV files containing information about transactions, calender, customers, products, returns, regions, stores.
  
  Here we used Power BI to:
  
    • Connect and shape the raw data
    • Build a relational data model
    • Add new calculated columns and DAX measures, and finally
    • Design an interactive report to analyze and visualize the data.
